tinyramfs - configuration file
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A tinyramfs configuration file is written in POSIX sh.\& Configuration is done
via variable asignment (eg.\& \fBoption=value\fR).\& Special characters and whitespace
must be quoted or escaped, more info: \fBsh\fR(1).\& By default tinyramfs looks to
\fB/etc/tinyramfs/config\fR for a configuration file.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Option marked with \fB(bool)\fR can hold a value of true or false.\& False if the
variable is unset or empty, true otherwise.\&
.PP
Some options only apply to certain hooks and have been categorized accordingly.\&
.PP
Options which expect a device as a value can also refer to the device via
\fBUUID\fR, \fBLABEL\fR, and \fBPARTUUID\fR (eg.\& LABEL=<label>).\& This requires a blkid
utility which supports that identifier.\&
